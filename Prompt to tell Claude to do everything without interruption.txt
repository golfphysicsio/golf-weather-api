EXECUTE WITHOUT ASKING FOR APPROVAL

You have FULL AUTHORITY to proceed with everything in the deployment plan.

DO NOT ASK ME:
- "Should I proceed with X?"
- "Do you want me to continue?"
- "Shall I deploy this?"
- "Ready to move to the next step?"

JUST DO IT:
- Push all commits
- Deploy everything
- Update all files
- Run all tests
- Create all logs

ONLY STOP IF:
- An actual error occurs (deployment fails, tests fail, etc.)
- You encounter a technical blocker you can't resolve
- You need information you don't have (like a password or URL)

OTHERWISE: Work through ALL tasks continuously from start to finish without pausing.

Start now and don't stop until everything is deployed and verified.
