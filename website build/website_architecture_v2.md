### The Problem (Expanded)

**Headline:**
```
Why Launch Monitor Data Needs Context
```

**Content:**
```
Your launch monitor captures perfect ball flight data. But that 
280-yard drive means different things in different places:

• Denver (5,280 ft): Thin air = ball flies 8% farther
• Miami (sea level, 95°F): Hot humid air = ball flies 3% farther  
• Phoenix (100°F, dry): Desert heat = ball flies 4% farther
• Chicago (40°F, winter): Cold dense air = ball flies 6% shorter

Without atmospheric adjustments, your data is incomplete.
With our API, your data is tour-accurate everywhere.
```

### Use Cases

### The Science

**Headline:**
```
Tour-Level Accuracy, Backed By Physics
```

**Content:**
```
We use the same atmospheric physics calculations as aerospace 
engineers and ballistics experts:

Air Density Calculation:
ρ = P / (R × T)
Where density affects drag force: Fd = ½ρv²CdA

Wind Vector Analysis:
True ball speed = Ball velocity + Wind vector
Drag changes based on relative airspeed

Temperature Effects:
Cold air = Higher density = More drag = Shorter distance
Ball compression also changes: Colder = less energy transfer

The result? Tour-accurate predictions within 2% of actual carry distance.

**Headline:**
```
How It Works In Your Venue
```

**Step-by-step:**

```
1. Player Arrives
   "What's your handicap?"
   "I'm about a 15"

2. Choose Game Mode
   Screen shows: Hurricane Hero, Desert Inferno, Maximum Tailwind...
   "Let's try Maximum Tailwind!"

3. Play
   Our API calculates with 150mph tailwind + their handicap
   Normal 230-yard drive → 400+ YARDS!
   
4. React
   "FOUR HUNDRED YARDS?!"
   *Everyone pulls out phones*
   *TikTok posts immediately*

5. Share
   #MaximumTailwind #TopgolfScottsdale #500YardDrive
   Free marketing for your venue

6. Return
   "We're coming back Friday to try Hurricane Hero"
   Repeat visit secured
```

### Science Section (Gaming Context)

**Headline:**
```
Real Physics. Extreme Conditions.
```

**Content:**
```
"Wait, can you REALLY hit 500 yards in a 150mph tailwind?"

Yes. Here's the math:

Normal Drive (280 yards):
• Ball speed: 167 mph
• Air resistance reduces carry by ~40%
• Final distance: 280 yards

With 150mph Tailwind:
• Ball speed: Still 167 mph forward
• But relative to the air: Only 17 mph!
• Air resistance drops by ~95%
• Ball stays airborne much longer
• Ball decelerates much slower
• Final distance: 475+ yards

It's not magic. It's atmospheric physics.

The same physics that explains why balls fly farther in Denver (thin air)
explains why they fly farther with extreme tailwinds.

Every calculation is mathematically accurate. We just let you dial up 
the conditions to 11.

### FAQ Section

**Headline:**
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

**Professional API FAQs:**

```
Q: What's the difference between Professional and Gaming?
A: Professional uses realistic conditions (0-35mph wind, playable temps) 
   for accurate training. Gaming uses extreme conditions (150mph wind, 
   arctic temps) for entertainment.

Q: Do I need a launch monitor?
A: Yes. Professional API requires ball flight data from your launch 
   monitor (ball speed, launch angle, spin rate).

Q: What's a "calculation"?
A: One API call = one calculation. Typical single shot = 1 calculation.

Q: Can I test before buying?
A: Yes! 14-day free trial, no credit card required.

Q: What if I need more than 100K calls/day?
A: Contact us for Enterprise pricing. We support unlimited scale.
```

**Gaming API FAQs:**

```
Q: Do we need special equipment?
A: No! Works with your existing golf simulator. Just need internet 
   and API integration (4-8 hours).

Q: What's a "bay"?
A: One hitting area/simulator. 20 bays = up to 20 simultaneous games.

Q: Are the 500-yard drives real physics?
A: Yes! 150mph tailwind actually produces those results. It's extreme 
   but mathematically accurate.

Q: Can we create custom game modes?
A: Venue Pro and Enterprise plans include custom preset creation.

Q: What if we're a chain?
A: Enterprise plan supports multi-location with volume discounts.

## 5. SCIENCE PAGE (/science)

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
```
Real Physics. Real Math. Real Results.
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Every calculation uses atmospheric physics and ballistic mathematics—
not guesswork or approximations.
```

### The Physics Section

**Headline:**
```
How Atmospheric Conditions Affect Golf Balls
```

**Content organized in sections:**

**1. Air Density**
```
The Foundation: Air Density Formula

ρ = P / (R × T)

Where:
• ρ = air density (kg/m³)
• P = air pressure (Pascals)
• R = specific gas constant for air (287 J/kg·K)
• T = temperature (Kelvin)

What This Means:
• Hotter air = Less dense = Less drag = Ball flies farther
• Higher altitude = Less pressure = Less dense = Ball flies farther
• Colder air = More dense = More drag = Ball flies shorter

Real Example:
Denver (5,280 ft, 75°F): Air is 17% less dense than sea level
Result: Driver carries 8% farther (~22 yards for 280-yard drive)
```

**2. Drag Force**
```
How Air Resistance Works

Fd = ½ρv²CdA

Where:
• Fd = drag force (Newtons)
• ρ = air density
• v = velocity (m/s)
• Cd = drag coefficient (~0.25 for golf ball)
• A = cross-sectional area (m²)

What This Means:
• Drag force is proportional to air density
• Less dense air (altitude/heat) = Less drag
• More dense air (cold/low altitude) = More drag

The Magnus Effect:
Spinning golf ball creates pressure differential
Backspin = lift = ball stays airborne longer
```

**3. Wind Effects**
```
Vector Analysis

True ball velocity = Ball speed + Wind vector

Headwind:
• Increases relative air speed
• Dramatically increases drag
• Ball decelerates faster
• Shorter distance

Tailwind:
• Decreases relative air speed
• Dramatically decreases drag  
• Ball decelerates slower
• Longer distance

Why Tailwinds Have Bigger Effect:
30mph headwind: Relative speed = 167 + 30 = 197 mph (drag ↑44%)
30mph tailwind: Relative speed = 167 - 30 = 137 mph (drag ↓28%)

Drag is squared, so reductions matter more than increases!
```

**4. Temperature Effects**
```
Two Mechanisms:

Air Density (Primary Effect):
Hot air is less dense → Less drag → Farther
Cold air is more dense → More drag → Shorter

Ball Compression (Secondary Effect):
Hot ball compresses more → More energy transfer → Farther
Cold ball compresses less → Less energy transfer → Shorter

Combined Effect:
95°F vs 32°F: ~10-15 yard difference on driver
```

**5. Altitude Effects**
```
Why Denver Is Different

Pressure drops ~1 inHg per 1,000 ft elevation

Sea level (30 inHg): Standard air density
5,280 ft (24.5 inHg): 17% less dense air

Result:
280-yard drive → ~302 yards in Denver
180-yard 7-iron → ~194 yards in Denver

Mexico City (7,350 ft): Even more dramatic
280-yard drive → ~310 yards

This is why tour pros adjust club selection for altitude.
```

### Validation Section

**Headline:**
```
Accuracy Validation
```

**Content:**
```
We've validated our calculations against:

✓ PGA Tour ShotLink data (1M+ real shots)
✓ Launch monitor manufacturer specifications
✓ Aerospace ballistics research
✓ Tournament data from various altitudes/conditions

Accuracy:
• Carry distance: Within 2% of actual
• Total distance: Within 3% of actual
• Trajectory: Within 5% of measured

Our calculations match real-world results at:
• Sea level and 8,000+ ft altitude
• Temperatures from 32°F to 105°F  
• Wind speeds from 0-35 mph
• Humidity from 10-100%

```

### Extreme Conditions Section

**Headline:**
```
What About The Gaming API's Extreme Conditions?
```

**Content:**
```
"Is a 500-yard drive in 150mph wind REALLY possible?"

Yes. The physics is identical—we just extend the ranges.

The Math:
Normal drive (280 yards, calm):
• Ball speed: 167 mph
• Air resistance: ~40% of potential distance lost
• Actual carry: 280 yards

With 150mph tailwind:
• Ball speed relative to air: 167 - 150 = 17 mph!
• Air resistance: ~95% LESS than normal
• Ball stays airborne 40% longer
• Ball decelerates 80% slower
• Actual carry: ~475 yards

This is the same physics that explains:
• Why bullets go farther at altitude (less air resistance)
• Why planes fly more efficiently at altitude (less drag)
• Why race cars add spoilers (to CREATE drag)

The gaming API doesn't use "fake" physics. It uses real physics 
with extreme conditions that are theoretically possible but rarely 
encountered in real golf.

It's entertainment, but it's honest entertainment.

### The Math Behind Extreme Tailwinds

**Headline:**
```
Deep Dive: The 500-Yard Drive
```

**Step-by-step calculation:**

```
Starting Conditions:
• Ball speed: 167 mph (75 m/s)
• Launch angle: 11.2°
• Spin: 2600 rpm
• Calm air

Normal Flight:
• Air resistance at 167 mph: Fd = ½(1.225)(75²)(0.25)(0.0014) = 1.20 N
• Deceleration: 1.20 / 0.046 kg = 26 m/s²
• Flight time: ~6 seconds
• Carry: 280 yards

With 150mph (67 m/s) Tailwind:
• Relative air speed: 75 - 67 = 8 m/s
• Air resistance at 8 m/s: Fd = ½(1.225)(8²)(0.25)(0.0014) = 0.014 N
• Deceleration: 0.014 / 0.046 kg = 0.3 m/s²
• Ball decelerates 87 times slower!
• Flight time: ~11 seconds (83% longer in air)
• Carry: ~475 yards

Every number is real physics.

## 6. ABOUT PAGE (/about)

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
```
Built By Golfers Who Love Physics
```

**Subheadline:**
```
We believe every player deserves accurate data and 
unforgettable experiences—backed by real science.
```

### Our Mission

**Content:**
```
Golf technology is incredible. Launch monitors measure ball flight 
with millimeter precision. Simulators recreate famous courses. 
Data analytics optimize every aspect of the game.

But something was missing: atmospheric physics.

A 280-yard drive in Phoenix isn't the same as 280 in Seattle. 
Players who practice in Denver struggle when they travel to sea level. 
The data was precise, but incomplete.

We built Golf Physics API to solve this:

For professional users: Tour-accurate atmospheric adjustments so 
players see true distances anywhere, in any conditions.

For entertainment venues: Extreme weather game modes that create 
unforgettable moments and viral content.

Same physics engine. Two perfect applications.

Our Mission:
Enhance the golfer experience through accurate atmospheric physics—
whether that means helping a player improve their game or giving them 
a 500-yard drive they'll never forget.
```

### Our Approach

**Headline:**
```
Real Physics. No Shortcuts.
```

**Content:**
```
We don't use approximations or "good enough" formulas.

Every calculation uses:
✓ Atmospheric physics (air density, pressure, temperature)
✓ Ballistic mathematics (drag coefficients, Magnus effect)
✓ Vector analysis (wind components, relative velocity)
✓ Validated against real-world data

This means:
• Professional API: Within 2% of actual carry distance
• Gaming API: Mathematically accurate even at extremes

Whether it's a 30mph wind at a tournament or a 150mph wind 
in a game—the physics is always real.
```
